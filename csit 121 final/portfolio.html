            <div>
            So, at the start of the semester, we kicked off this cool project named "My Favorite Recipe."
             Basically, the deal was to build up a simple website using HTML and CSS, 
             all about our ultimate go-to recipe and why we liked it.
            Over the course of the semester, our website became more and more interactive.
            We picked up loads of new tricks and topics that we incorporated into our website as we went along. 
             For example, we inclued a nutritional table, forms and even multimedia! 
            It's been a wild ride of learning and tinkering, 
              turning my site into this awesome mix of tech skills and culinary passion.

          <center><b> Featured project #2: "My three things"</b></center>
          <div>
            This project was a big deal for me because I had to venture into the world of multi-page websites for the first time. 
            We were recuired to create and design a site about three random things we love. 
            My site had a homepage that welcomes the user, and subpages for each of those random favorite things.
             It was like making a digital scrapbook, but, you know, on the internet.
